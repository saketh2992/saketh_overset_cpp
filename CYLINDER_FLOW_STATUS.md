# Cylinder Flow Simulation - Current Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Mesh Generation**
   - ‚úÖ Rectangular background mesh (-5 to 10, -5 to 5) with 100√ó100 points
   - ‚úÖ Circular component mesh (radius 0.5 to 1.0) with 50√ó50 points
   - ‚úÖ Overset mesh connectivity (hole cutting, boundary marking, interpolation setup)

2. **Solver**
   - ‚úÖ Background rectangular mesh is being solved
   - ‚úÖ Freestream boundary conditions applied (U=1, V=0)
   - ‚úÖ Solver runs to completion without crashes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

### Circular Mesh Solver Not Yet Implemented

The **circular component mesh** is generated correctly but the Navier-Stokes solver for polar coordinates is not yet implemented. This is why you see:
```
Active computational cells - Background: 10000, Component (circular): 0
```

**What's happening:**
- The solver functions (`SolveUV`, `SolveP`, `CorrectVelocity`, `LinearInterpolation`, `UpdateFlux`) check if the mesh is rectangular
- If the mesh is circular (`dynamic_cast` returns `nullptr`), they return early without doing anything
- This prevents crashes but means the circular mesh equations aren't being solved

## üîß What Needs to be Implemented

To fully enable cylinder flow simulation, you need to implement polar coordinate versions of:

### 1. **LinearInterpolation_Polar()**
   - Compute face fluxes in polar coordinates (r, Œ∏)
   - Face areas: `r*dtheta` (radial faces), `dr` (angular faces)
   
### 2. **DiffusiveFlux_Polar()**
   - Laplacian in polar coordinates:
     ```
     ‚àá¬≤u = (1/r)‚àÇ/‚àÇr(r‚àÇu/‚àÇr) + (1/r¬≤)‚àÇ¬≤u/‚àÇŒ∏¬≤
     ```

### 3. **UpdateFlux_Polar()**
   - Pressure gradient in polar coordinates
   
### 4. **SolveUV_Polar()**
   - Momentum equations in polar coordinates
   - Loop over `i` (0 to Ntheta) and `j` (0 to Nr)
   
### 5. **SolveP_Polar()**
   - Pressure Poisson equation in polar coordinates
   
### 6. **CorrectVelocity_Polar()**
   - Velocity correction with polar coordinate pressure gradients

## üìù Temporary Workaround

For now, the simulation approximates the cylinder effect by:
1. ‚úÖ Removing grid points inside the cylinder (hole cutting works)
2. ‚úÖ Marking cylinder boundary as UNUSED
3. ‚úÖ Background mesh sees the "hole" left by the circular mesh
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è But the circular mesh itself isn't solving fluid equations

This gives a **rough approximation** where the flow sees an obstacle, but lacks the accuracy of a proper overset solution.

## üéØ Next Steps

**Option 1: Quick Fix (Lower Accuracy)**
- Use only rectangular meshes for both background and component
- This will work with current solver (already tested)
- Less accurate for circular geometry

**Option 2: Full Implementation (Higher Accuracy)**
- Implement polar coordinate solver functions listed above
- Requires understanding of polar coordinate CFD
- Provides accurate cylinder flow results

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep circular mesh for geometry representation
- Use it only for hole cutting and boundary conditions
- Background mesh does all the solving (current state)

## üìä Expected Results (When Fully Implemented)

At **Re = 100**, you should see:
- Symmetric wake with two standing vortices behind cylinder
- Drag coefficient (Cd) ‚âà 1.0-1.2
- No vortex shedding (occurs at Re > 47)

At **Re = 200**, you would see:
- Karman vortex street (periodic vortex shedding)
- Strouhal number (St) ‚âà 0.2

## üîç How to Check Current Results

Even without circular mesh solver, you can check:
```bash
# Look at output files
ls TEMP/CylinderFlow_Re100_bg100x100_cyl50x50_R0.50/

# Files generated:
bgPtType.txt          # Background mesh point types
compPtType.txt        # Circular mesh point types  
output_bgMesh.dat     # Background flow solution
output_circMesh.dat   # Circular mesh (will show initial conditions only)
```

The background mesh solution will show flow around a "hole" where the cylinder is.

**Status**: Partially functional - mesh generation complete, solver needs polar coordinate implementation for full accuracy.
